# GSM Assessment Toolkit - GAT

GAT is an evaluation framework for assessing security-related aspects of mobile networks based on the GSM standard.

The framework mainly relies on [gr-gsm](https://github.com/ptrkrysik/gr-gsm) for the processing of GSM-related information.

More information will be added soon...
